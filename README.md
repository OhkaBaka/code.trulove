## Portfolio site code, always a work in progress.

5/28/2024 - Redesigned the landing page to put local links in the left column, I put some verbage in the right column I'll likely change to display the README in the near future.

5/15/2024 - Initial functional deploy and various tweaks
- Bax isn't fixed, need to fix that... fix... that... sigh
- Colors are wrong... not sure how to solve yet, needs to be light but not bright, medium-high contrast... etc..
- Title is... 1992 cringe... but we'll get that sorted in time

5/16/2024 - Tweaked colors some more, adjusted size of bax (for fun), set bax to fixed to see if I can make mobile look better, added patch notes to README
